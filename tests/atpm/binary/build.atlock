;; Anarchy Tools Package Manager lock file

;; If you want to pin a package to a git commit add a ':pin-commit'
;; line to that package definition. This will override all version
;; information the build files specify.
;;
;; You may override the repository URL for a package by specifying
;; it in an ':override-url' line. This is very handy if you develop
;; the dependency in parallel to the package that uses it
